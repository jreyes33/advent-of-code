My solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

## Running Zig Solutions

```
cd zig
zig run <DAY>.zig
```

## Running Lox Solutions

You'll need to get a [Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) interpreter;
you can use one of [mine](https://github.com/jreyes33/crafting-interpreters). Then:

```
lox lox/<DAY>.lox
```
